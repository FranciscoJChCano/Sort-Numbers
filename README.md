Simplified Code Explanation:


Data Input:

Ask the user for the number of elements to sort.


Use a for loop to collect each number.


If the number entered is not 4, add it to the list. Otherwise, print a message and skip adding it.


Order Selection:



Ask the user to enter 'A' for ascending order or 'D' for descending order.


Sorting:



Sort the list in ascending order using Collections.sort() if the user chooses 'A' or 'a'.


Sort the list in descending order using Collections.sort(numbers, Collections.reverseOrder()) if the user chooses 'D' or 'd'.


If the user enters an invalid option, print a message and exit the program.


Data Output:



Print the sorted list based on the user's choice.


This simplified version maintains the core functionality while making the code more concise and easier to understand.
